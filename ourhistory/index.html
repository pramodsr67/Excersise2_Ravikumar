    <p>Sri. Krishna Murthy, our founder is a true example of a light that has kindly led, a beacon that has inspired, and a lamp that has spread its gentle beams to brighten lives around education and achievement. Life was not easy for him when he came to Bangalore. He educated himself so as to secure a teaching job in a school in North Bangalore. The idea to start a school germinated in his mind when he realized that the middle class families in South Bangalore had to send their children to the Cantonment area for good education.
    </p>
    <p>All he thought of when he started the nursery school, was to provide a home away from home, which had a supportive and stimulating environment. With this in mind, he started our nursery school on a small scale at BSK III Stage in the year 1987. It was his belief that every child deserves the very best start in life, and right from the beginning he made it her purpose to provide just that to all the children who entered his schoolâ€™s doors.</p>
    <p>Our school has grown to what it is today because we have never forgotten his noble ideals of fostering strong values, mutual understanding, respect for our culture and high personal endeavour. Our motto is inspired by his wonderful life; to serve whole heart, and brighten the way for others.
